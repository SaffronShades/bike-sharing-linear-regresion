# Boom Bike - Linear Regression Assignment
> You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

Used Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict the demand in future with the given data set and find highly positive and negatively impacting factors that influence the bike demand.
